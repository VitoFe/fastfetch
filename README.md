# Fastfetch

Fastfetch is a [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)-like tool for fetching system information and displaying them in a pretty way. It is written in pure c, with performance and customizability in mind. Currently, Linux, Android, FreeBSD, MacOS and Windows 7+ are supported.

## Customization

With customization and speed being two competing goals, this project actually builds two executables.  
The main one being `fastfetch`, which can be very greatly configured via flags. These flags can be made persistent in `~/.config/fastfetch/config.conf`. To view the available options run `fastfetch --help`.  
The second executable being built is called `flashfetch`, which is configured at compile time to eliminate any possible overhead. Configuration of it can be very easily done in [`src/flashfetch.c`](src/flashfetch.c).  
At the moment the performance difference is measurable, but too small to be human recognizable. But the leap will get bigger with more and more options coming, and on slow machines this might actually make a difference.  

There are some premade config files in [`presets`](presets), including the ones used for the screenshots above. You can load them using `--load-config <filename>`. They may also serve as a good example for format arguments.

## Dependencies

Fastfetch dynamically loads needed libraries if they are available. On Linux, its only hard dependencies are `libc` (any implementation of the c standard library), `libdl` and [`libpthread`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html) (if built with multithreading support). They are all shipped with [`glibc`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), which is already installed on most linux distributions.  


The following libraries are used if present at runtime:

### Linux and FreeBSD

* [`libpci`](https://github.com/pciutils/pciutils): GPU output.
* [`libvulkan`](https://www.vulkan.org/): Vulkan module & fallback for GPU output.
* [`libxcb-randr`](https://xcb.freedesktop.org/),
    [`libXrandr`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxrandr),
    [`libxcb`](https://xcb.freedesktop.org/),
    [`libX11`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11): At least one of them sould be present in X11 sessions for better resolution detection and faster WM detection. The `*randr` ones provide multi monitor support The `libxcb*` ones usually have better performance.
* [`libwayland-client`](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/): Better resolution performance and output in wayland sessions. Supports different refresh rates per monitor.
* [`libGIO`](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/unstable/): Needed for values that are only stored GSettings.
* [`libDConf`](https://developer.gnome.org/dconf/unstable/): Needed for values that are only stored in DConf + Fallback for GSettings.
* [`libmagickcore` (ImageMagick)](https://www.imagemagick.org/): Images in terminal using sixel or kitty graphics protocol.
* [`libchafa`](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa): Image output as ascii art.
* [`libZ`](https://www.zlib.net/): Faster image output when using kitty graphics protocol.
* [`libDBus`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus): Needed for detecting current media player and song.
* [`libEGL`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/),
    [`libGLX`](https://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/GLX/),
    [`libOSMesa`](https://docs.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html): At least one of them is needed by the OpenGL module for gl context creation.
* [`libOpenCL`](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/): OpenCL module
* [`libXFConf`](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfconf): Needed for XFWM theme and XFCE Terminal font.
* [`libsqlite3`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): Needed for pkg & rpm package count.
* [`librpm`](http://rpm.org/): Slower fallback for rpm package count. Needed on openSUSE.
* [`libcJSON`](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON): Needed for Windows Terminal font ( WSL ).

### macOS

* [`MediaRemote`](https://iphonedev.wiki/index.php/MediaRemote.framework): Need for Media detection. It's a private framework provided by newer macOS system.
* [`MoltenVK`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK): Vulkan driver for macOS. [`molten-vk`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/molten-vk.rb)
* [`libmagickcore` (ImageMagick)](https://www.imagemagick.org/): Images in terminal using sixel graphics protocol. [`imagemagick`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/imagemagick.rb)
* [`libchafa`](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa): Image output as ascii art. [`chafa`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/chafa.rb)

For the image logo, iTerm with iterm image protocol should work. Apple Terminal is not supported.

### Windows

* [`libcJSON`](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON): Used for Windows Terminal font detection.
* [`wlanapi`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wlanapi/): A system dll which isn't supported by Windows Server by default. Used for Wifi info detection.
* [`libvulkan`](https://www.vulkan.org/): Vulkan module. Usually has been provided by GPU drivers.
* [`libOpenCL`](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/): OpenCL module

Note: In Windows 7, 8 and 8.1, [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html) is required to run fastfetch due to [the lack of ASCII escape code native support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#DOS,_OS/2,_and_Windows). In addition, special build `fastfetch-windows-old` in [Github Actions](https://github.com/LinusDierheimer/fastfetch/actions) is provided to support these old systems, which

1. Build with the ancient MSVCRT C runtime library, instead of the modern [UCRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/universal-crt-deployment) C runtime library
2. Disable stdout application buffer, which seems to problematic for ConEmu.

For the image logo, only chafa is supported due to [the design flaw of ConPTY](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/1173). In addition, chafa support is not built by default due to the massive dependencies of imagemagick. You must built it yourself.

### Android

* [`freetype`](https://www.freetype.org/): Used for Termux font detection.
* [`libvulkan`](https://www.vulkan.org/): Vulkan module, also used for GPU detection. Usually has been provided by Android system.

## Building

fastfetch uses [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/) for building. [`pkg-config`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) is recommended for better library detection. The simplest steps to build the fastfetch and flashfetch binaries are:  
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target fastfetch --target flashfetch
```

If the build process fails to find the headers for a library listed in [dependencies](#dependencies), fastfetch will simply build without support for that specific feature. This means, it won't look for it at runtime and just act like it isn't available.

### Building on Windows

Currently GCC or clang is required (MSVC is not supported). MSYS2 with CLANG64 sub system is suggested (and tested) to build fastfetch.

## FAQ

Q: Why do you need a very performant version of neofetch?
> I like putting neofetch in my ~/.bashrc to have a system overwiew whenever I use the terminal, but the slow speed annoyed me, so I created this. Also neofetch didn't output everything correctly (e.g Font is displayed as "[Plasma], Noto Sans, 10 [GTK2/3]") and writing my own tool gave me the possibility to fine tune it to run perfectly on at least my configuration.

Q: It does not display [*] correctly for me, what can I do?
> This is most likely because your system is not implemented (yet). At the moment I am focusing more on making the core app better, than adding more configurations. Feel free to open a pull request if you want to add support for your configuration
